DESCRIPTION

Highlight quickfix errors and location list entries in buffer. This plugin
was designed to support the editqf vim script (vimscript#3557) but it also
works very well stand alone.

The latest development version is available at
https://github.com/jceb/vim-hier.

USAGE

The following commands are provided:
	:HierStart		" enable hier highlighting
	:HierStop		" disable hier highlighting
	:HierUpdate		" update error highlighting for current buffer
	:HierClear		" remove highlighting - it will be displayed again when :HierUpdate is called

CUSTOMIZATION

The highlight group can be customized by setting the following variable.
Setting a variable to the empty string "" will disable highlighting of that
group:
	let g:hier_highlight_group_qf  = 'ErrorMsg'
	let g:hier_highlight_group_loc = 'Search'

Enable/disable highlighting highlighting by default:
	let g:hier_enabled             = 1
